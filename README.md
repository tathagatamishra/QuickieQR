## What can a QR Code do?

Because of its versatility, a QR Code can be programmed to do a multitude of things. It can be split into two formats: Dynamic and Static. A Dynamic QR Code is useful for businesses or nonprofits in their marketing strategy because of its advantages. Though it needs a subscription to work, it is a small price to pay compared to the benefits it offers. Dynamic QR Code solutions are editable.

## Does a QR Code Have To Be Black And White?

Although most QR Codes are black and white, they don't have to be. A QR Code can be any colour and can even include more than 2 different colors.

## Can QR Codes Be Inverted Or Mirrored? 

Another common question about QR Codes is if they are inverted or mirrored, will they still work? The simple answer is No. Mirroring a QR Codes or inverting it will prevent "most" barcode readers from being able to decode the image and extract any data from it.

## Can a QR Code Be Rotated? 

Yes, A QR Code is omnidirectional and can be viewed / scanned any way around. The QR Codes themselves include position detection patterns (a Finder Patterns) which helps the scanner identify the correct orientation for the image.

## QR Code Error Correction

Yes, QR codes do have error correction. This error correction can ensure that a QR Code remains readable when as much as 30% of the code is corrupt. In this example, red ink covers a chunk of the QR Code but the QR Code can still be read successfully.

Error Correction is always enabled to some extent, you can't turn it off. When a code is being created, it's down to the designer to specify which of the 4 different level of error correction they want. The designer can select from the following:

L[ow] - up to 7% damage
M[edium] - up to 15% damage
Q[uality] - up to 25% damage
H[igh] - up to 30% damage

Error correction comes at a cost, after all nothing is free, and that cost is that the higher the level of Error correction you apply to your QR Code, the more space you lose to store actual data.

## How Many Characters / Digits Can A QR Code Store?

QR Codes can store data up to a maximum of 3Kb, But how does that translate into digits or actual text?

When a QR Code is created, the user chooses the encoding that is to be used and sets the type of data that the QR Code will store. The chosen data type and encoding have a big impact on the number of characters that can be saved within the QR Code.

As an example, if you were to create a QR Code that was only to contain numerical data, then you would have the ability to encode up to 7089 digits.

If you were to create a QR Code that would store alphanumeric data, then the maximum number of characters you could store would reduce to 4296.

There are other types of QR Code that are less common but that you should be aware of, and these each have their own limitations. For example Micro QR Codes can store a lot less data (up to 35 numerical characters). iQR Codes on the other hand have much greater capacity (up to 40,000 numerical characters).

Numeric OnlyMax.......7089 characters
AlphanumericMax.......4296 characters
Binary (8 Bits)Max....2953 characters
